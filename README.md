<center><b><i>Werewolves VS Vampires! Which team will survive? How will the Avatar impact the final result?</i></b></center><br>
A simple fun game, in which a team of werewolves fights against a team of vampires. The last team standing wins. The Avatar (player) opts in favor of a team which he can help by using magical potions. The potions increase each creature's health to the maximum amount, thus aiding the team in surviving.
